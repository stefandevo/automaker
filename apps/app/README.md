# Automaker

Automaker is an autonomous AI development studio that helps you build software faster using AI-powered agents. It provides a visual Kanban board interface to manage features, automatically assigns AI agents to implement them, and tracks progress through an intuitive workflow from backlog to verified completion.

## Getting Started

**Step 1:** Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:AutoMaker-Org/automaker.git
cd automaker
```

**Step 2:** Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

**Step 3:** Get your Claude subscription token:

```bash
claude setup-token
```

This command will authenticate you via your browser and print a token to your terminal.

> **⚠️ Warning:** This command will print your token to your terminal. Be careful if you're streaming or sharing your screen, as the token will be visible to anyone watching.

**Step 4:** Export the Claude Code OAuth token in your shell (optional - you can also enter it in the app's setup wizard):

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN="your-token-here"
```

Alternatively, you can enter your token directly in the Automaker setup wizard when you launch the app.

**Step 5:** Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev:electron
```

This will start both the Next.js development server and the Electron application.
